Player spaceship vs AI/Other player spaceship
text graphics
display stats of each ship, HP/AP (Attack damage can be AP times a randomizer of some sort, maybe have misses, crits, glancing blows)
players take turns, first pass will just be one player attacking, then the other, then back to the first until one is dead

second pass add different weapons to the ship, use either cooldowns or ammo to limit use
add armor/shields
maybe add action points and a ship can only use x action points per turn, different weapons/abilities/moving take different amounts of points

third pass add ability to attack opponents weapons to disable them
have the weapons be div objects, clicking on them sets the value of a hidden input in the ability form

fourth pass add non weapon subsystems; bridge, engineering, weapons control

fifth pass add engines and weapon ranges
calcualte distance between the two ships, engine speed determines how many action points it takes to close a distance
weapons can only attack within their range

sixth pass add special abilities; emp, ecm, ewar, things of that nature

seventh pass add graphics






for the energy bar, have two filler divs, make the top one shrink when mousing over an ability, make them both shrink when clicking on it
